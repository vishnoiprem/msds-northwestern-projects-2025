# ================================================================

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

This assignment covered three fundamental concepts in statistical inference:
1. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** for sample proportions
2. **Sampling distributions** of the median statistic
3. **Point and interval estimation** with real data

All three tasks have been completed with comprehensive R code, visualizations, 
and detailed interpretations.

## 📊 TASK SUMMARIES

### TASK 1: Central Limit Theorem for Sample Proportions ✅

**What we did:**
- Simulated 10,000 samples for each scenario
- Tested n = 10, 30, 100, 250 (effect of sample size)
- Tested p = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 (effect of population proportion)
- Compared theoretical vs. simulated standard errors

**Key findings:**
- ✓ CLT works! Sample proportions follow normal distribution
- ✓ Simulated SEs matched theory within <1.3% error
- ✓ SE decreases with √n (not linearly with n)
- ✓ SE is maximized at p = 0.5 (most conservative)
- ✓ Rule: need np ≥ 10 AND n(1-p) ≥ 10 for good approximation

**Files generated:**

- `task1_part_a_plots.pdf` - Effect of sample size
- `task1_part_b_plots.pdf` - Effect of population proportion

### TASK 2: Monte Carlo Estimation of Median ✅

**What we did:**
- Evaluated whether median's sampling distribution follows normal curve
- Tested symmetric distributions (Normal, Uniform)
- Tested skewed distributions (Exponential, Chi-squared)
- Compared median vs. mean normality

**Key findings:**
- ✓ For SYMMETRIC distributions: Median distribution IS approximately normal
- ✗ For SKEWED distributions: Median distribution is NOT normal
- ✓ Median SE is ~1.25× larger than Mean SE (normal population)
- ✗ Median retains skewness much longer than mean
- ✓ CLT applies to MEANS, not medians (order statistics)

**Why this happens:**
1. CLT guarantees normality for sample means (based on sums)
2. Median is an order statistic (middle value), different math
3. Median is more "robust" but converges to normality more slowly
4. Need larger n for median (n ≥ 50-100 vs. n ≥ 30 for mean)

**Files generated:**
- `task2_monte_carlo_median.R` - Complete R code
- `task2_part1_normal_medians.pdf` - Symmetric distributions
- `task2_part1_uniform_medians.pdf` - Uniform distribution
- `task2_part2_exponential.pdf` - Skewed distributions
- `task2_part3_comparison.pdf` - Median vs. mean Q-Q plots
- `TASK2_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed report

### TASK 3: Point and Interval Estimation ✅

**What we did:**
- Analyzed cholesterol data from 315 adults
- Computed point estimates (mean, SD, SE)
- Constructed 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% confidence intervals
- Analyzed confidence-precision trade-off

**Key findings:**
- Sample mean: 200.44 mg/dL (borderline high range)
- Sample SD: 38.61 mg/dL (considerable variation)
- Standard error: 2.18 mg/dL (precise estimate)
- 95% CI: [196.16, 204.72] mg/dL

**The trade-off:**
- 80% CI: Width = 5.59 mg/dL (narrow, less confident)
- 90% CI: Width = 7.18 mg/dL (+28.5% wider)
- 95% CI: Width = 8.56 mg/dL (+53.2% wider)
- 99% CI: Width = 11.28 mg/dL (+101.8% wider - DOUBLED!)

**Key insight:** You cannot have both maximum confidence AND maximum precision!

**Files generated:**

- `task3_confidence_intervals.pdf` - 4-panel visualization
- `task3_sampling_distribution.pdf` - Conceptual diagram

## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS TO EMPHASIZE IN YOUR WRITE-UP

### From Task 1 (CLT for Proportions):
✓ "The Central Limit Theorem guarantees that sample proportions are approximately 
   normally distributed when np ≥ 10 and n(1-p) ≥ 10."

✓ "Standard error decreases with the square root of sample size, creating a trade-off 
   between precision and cost of data collection."

✓ "When p is unknown, using p = 0.5 provides a conservative (worst-case) sample size 
   estimate, as this maximizes the standard error."

### From Task 2 (Median Distribution):
✓ "The sampling distribution of the median does NOT universally follow a normal curve; 
   this depends critically on the population distribution."

✓ "For symmetric populations, the median's distribution approaches normality, but more 
   slowly than the mean (requiring larger sample sizes)."

✓ "For skewed populations, the median retains substantial skewness even at large sample 
   sizes, violating the normality assumption required for t-based inference."

✓ "The median's robustness to outliers (an advantage) comes at a cost: its sampling 
   distribution converges to normality more slowly than the mean."

### From Task 3 (Confidence Intervals):
✓ "Point estimates provide our best single guess for population parameters, but they 
   don't quantify uncertainty. Confidence intervals address this limitation."

✓ "A 95% confidence interval means that if we repeated the sampling process many times, 
   approximately 95% of the constructed intervals would contain the true parameter."

✓ "The confidence-precision trade-off is fundamental: higher confidence requires wider 
   intervals. We cannot maximize both simultaneously."

✓ "As confidence increases from 80% to 99%, interval width roughly doubles, illustrating 
   the diminishing returns of seeking very high confidence levels."

## 📈 STATISTICAL CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED

### 1. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- **Definition:** For large n, sampling distributions approach normality
- **Applications:** Sample means, sample proportions
- **Limitations:** Doesn't apply universally to all statistics (e.g., median)

### 2. Sampling Distributions
- **Concept:** Distribution of a statistic across many samples
- **Standard Error:** Standard deviation of the sampling distribution
- **Key insight:** Variability of statistic < Variability of data

### 3. Point Estimation
- **Purpose:** Single best guess for population parameter
- **Examples:** Sample mean (x̄) estimates μ, sample SD (s) estimates σ
- **Limitation:** No measure of uncertainty

### 4. Interval Estimation
- **Purpose:** Range of plausible values for parameter
- **Confidence Level:** Long-run capture rate (not probability!)
- **Trade-off:** Confidence ↔ Precision

### 5. Monte Carlo Simulation
- **Technique:** Use random sampling to approximate distributions
- **Power:** Can simulate complex scenarios analytically intractable
- **Validation:** Our simulations confirmed theoretical predictions

### 6. Statistical Inference
- **Goal:** Make conclusions about populations from samples
- **Uncertainty:** Always present due to sampling variability
- **Quantification:** Use SEs, CIs, and hypothesis tests
